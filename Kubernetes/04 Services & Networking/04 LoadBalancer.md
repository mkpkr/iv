If we want customers to access our web application, we don't want them to need the high port generated by NodePort.

We could add a proxy in between which accepts requests on port 80 and forwards them.

Or if we are using a cloud platform, we can create a service of type LoadBalancer which requests the cloud platform to create a network load balancer on top of our NodePort service. Users can then access this load balancer.
