In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. There can be only one [[Prototype]] for an object. And a class may extend only one other class.
 
A mixin is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it.

class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// mixin
let sayHiMixin = {
  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello ${this.name}`);
  },
  sayBye() {
    alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
  }
};
 
// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);
 
// now User can say hi
new User("Dude").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!
 

Mixins can make use of inheritance inside themselves.
 
For instance, here sayHiMixin inherits from sayMixin:
 
let sayMixin = {
  say(phrase) {
    alert(phrase);
  }
};
 
let sayHiMixin = {
  __proto__: sayMixin, // (or we could use Object.setPrototypeOf to set the prototype here)
 
  sayHi() {
    // call parent method
    super.say(`Hello ${this.name}`);
  },
  sayBye() {
    super.say(`Bye ${this.name}`);
  }
};

 
// copy the methods
Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin);
 
// now User can say hi
new User("Dude").sayHi(); // Hello Dude!
 
Please note that the call to the parent method super.say() from sayHiMixin looks for the method in the prototype of that mixin, not the class. Thatâ€™s because methods sayHi and sayBye were initially created in sayHiMixin. So even though they got copied, their [[HomeObject]] internal property references sayHiMixin so uses super methods from there (as discussed in Overriding -> "super Remembers its Parent")
