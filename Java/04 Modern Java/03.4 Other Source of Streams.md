# Arrays.java

```java
static Stream<T> stream(T[] array)
```

```java
static Stream<T> stream(T[] array,
                               int startInclusive,
                               int endExclusive)
```

```java
static IntStream stream(int[] array)
```

```java
static LongStream/DoubleStream ...
```

# Files.java

All methods must be used within a try-with-resources statement or similar control structure to ensure that the stream's open file is closed promptly after the stream's operations have completed.

- `{java} static Stream<String> lines(Path path) //same as Files.lines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`
- `{java} static Stream<String> lines(Path path, Charset cs)`

- `{java} static Stream<Path>   list(Path dir) `
- `{java} static Stream<Path>   walk(Path start, int maxDepth, FileVisitOption... options) `
- `{java} static Stream<Path>   walk(Path start, FileVisitOption... options)`

- `{java} //also see Scanner.tokens()`      

Regarding `lines()` - the file contents should not be modified during the execution of the terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream operation is undefined.

The other methods are lazily populated – look into the docs for more information about this and weak consistency/thread safety.
