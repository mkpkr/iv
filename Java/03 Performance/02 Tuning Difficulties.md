# Why is Java performance tuning hard?

Tuning for performance on the JVM (or, indeed, any other managed runtime) is inherently more difficult than for code that runs unmanaged. In a managed system, the entire point is to allow the runtime to take some control of the environment, so that the developer doesnâ€™t have to cope with every detail.

Some of the most important aspects of the Java platform that contribute to making tuning hard follow:

- Thread scheduling
- Garbage collection (GC)
- Just-in-time (JIT) compilation

Some notes about time in Java:

- Most systems have several different clocks inside them.
- Millisecond timings are safe and reliable.
- Higher-precision time needs careful handling to avoid drift.
