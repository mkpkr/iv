A `**WeakReference**` is a reference that **does not protect a referenced object from collection by GC**. i.e. garbage collects object when there are no Strong or Soft referencess.

Â If GC finds that an object is weakly reachable (reachable only through weak references), it'll clear the weak references to that object immediately. As such, they're good for keeping a reference to an object for which your program also keeps (strongly referenced) "associated information" somewere, like a wrapper for an object or some metadata etc. Anything that makes no sense to keep after the object it is associated with is GC-ed.

`WeakReference` objects can be used to create pointers to objects in your system while still allowing those objects to be reclaimed by the garbage-collector once they pass out of scope. They are good for canonical mapping (mapping via proxy object, which is responsible for giving back the object or null).

**`SoftReference`s** on the other hand are eligible for collection by garbage collector, but probably won't be collected until its memory is needed. i.e. garbage collects before OutOfMemoryError.

They are good for **caching external, re-creatable resources** as the GC typically delays clearing them. It is guaranteed though that all `SoftReference`s will get cleared before OutOfMemoryError is thrown, so they theoretically can't cause an OOME.

Typical use case example is keeping a parsed form of a contents from a file. You'd implement a system where you'd **load a file, parse it, and keep a `SoftReference`** to the root object of the parsed representation. Next time you need the file, you'll try to retrieve it through the `SoftReference`.
